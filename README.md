# TL;DR

- This so called **Zircon Blue** is just a simple Google Drive Clone that I made based on [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery)'s video, but there is a bit of adjustment just only for _Vietnamese_.
- The live website is in the description. You can try it out, althought I'm only making it for my friends, and my personal research lab.

## What can it do?

- ðŸ’½ Working as a imperfect clone of Google Drive.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Nunito, a custom Google Font.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying folders and it's contents. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
